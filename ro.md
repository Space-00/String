Ronime

What is Ronime?

Ronime is a windows app with which lets you stream or download anime for free

Important:

• Ronime doesn't host anything, not a single anime, not even the covers, nothing
• You can find new anime on Ronime when they're released, Ronime is up to date
• Download or stream for FREE
• This is the first release of Ronime, if you see any bugs, I'm sure you won't but if you do then open an issue


Sources:

You will see a new anime image whenever you run the app, the source is [Nekos](https://nekosapi.com/) which is an open-source anime image provider through API

The animes that are in the app are from somewhere that everyone knows where (you just need to use the app once and then you'll know), so cross that out ❌ we won't talk about it


I developed Ronime from scratch all by myself so a solo developer needs feedback or idea to make the app better, therefore, don't forget to open an issue for you ideas or bug report
