**What is Ronime?**
--------------------
Ronime is a windows app which lets you stream or download anime for free

**Important:**
--------------------
• Ronime doesn't host anything, not a single anime, not even the covers, nothing

• You can find new anime on Ronime when they're released, Ronime is up to date

• Download or stream for FREE

• This is the first release of Ronime, if you see any bugs, I'm sure you won't but if you do then open an [issue](https://github.com/Space-00/Ronime/issues)

**Sources:**
--------------------

You will see a new anime image whenever you run the app, the source is [Nekos](https://nekosapi.com/) which is an open-source anime image provider through API

The animes that are in the app are from somewhere that everyone knows where (you just need to use the app once and then you'll know), so cross that out ❌ we won't talk about that

I developed Ronime from scratch all by myself so a solo developer needs feedbacks or ideas to make the app better, therefore, don't forget to open an [issue](https://github.com/Space-00/Ronime/issues) for your ideas or bug report
